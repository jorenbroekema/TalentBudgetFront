# TalentBudgetFront
Front-end for TalentBudgetApp

Guys, there's a local config here similar to the backend application.properties.
Make sure you have a `localconfig.json` file in your root directory
```
var localConfig = {
	'port' : 8082
}
```
Change the port to your server port, same one as in the last line of your application.properties in your backend
